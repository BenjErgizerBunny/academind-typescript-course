//difference between var and let is the scope 

//var  has global and function scope.  
//var can be defined inside of a code block and reference outside of the code block
////this is because block scopes are not applied to var


//let and const have global, function and block scopes
//// Therefore if defined inside of a code block, they are not accessable outside of that code block
